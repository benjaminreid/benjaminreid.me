Straight off, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that my favourite game of 2013 has to be Naughty Dog's _The Last Of Us_.

I'm sure a lot people would say the exact same due to it's huge popularity and near perfect review scores but I enjoyed the experience that much that it comes out as one of my favourite games of all time &mdash; up there with the Final Fantasy's and Metal Gear Solid's.

Rather than give it a hefty review (it needs no more of these), or pick it apart piece by piece, I'm just going to talk about why it has become one of my all time favourites.

### Gore, done right

Adding gore into games is easy, often overused and more often than not, a cheap party trick. The Last Of Us however use this as part of their core story line, the Clickers.

The game does a great job of reminding you that despite the Clickers horrific form, they were once human. Only when push comes to shove do you have to take them out, the result is a brutal melee attack. As you are pushed into a corner, the point of desperation before you retaliate, this keeps your character feeling human as opposed to games where they see gore as "fun".

### And of course, Joel &amp; Ellie

At the end of the day, everything else is just background noise. The game for me is about these two people and the relationship they share.
