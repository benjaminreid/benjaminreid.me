Towards the end of last year I'd say I made a fair few big changes in my life. I upped sticks to another part of Bristol, moved in with my girlfriend, and to top it off I also decided to change jobs &mdash; all at the same time!

What brought on the sudden change was Penny uprooting from Peterborough to Bristol, just as I did three years ago.

I first came to Bristol because I manged to nab a job at the illustrious Aardman Animations as their humble junior web developer. This was on an initial four month contract and I didn't have much hope for sticking around in Bristol. That was until I fell in love with the city, and Aardman also kindly decided to keep me on a more permanent basis.

I owe a lot to Aardman, especially the brilliant team of friends I got to work with. It's definitely been a once in a life time experience but I felt it was time to move on.

Albeit, my time there was nothing short of awesome. Thank-you guys.

## Where am I now?

I'm working at [Simpleweb](http://simpleweb.co.uk). Here I get to design and build web apps
