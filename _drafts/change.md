Towards the end of last year I made a fair few big changes in my life. I moved house, moved in with my girlfriend, and to top it off I also decided to change jobs at the same time.

I think what brought on the sudden change was Penny uprooting from Peterborough to Bristol, just as I did three years ago.

I first came to Bristol because I manged to nab a job at the illustrious Aardman Animations as their humble junior web developer. This was on an initial four month contract and I didn't have much hope for sticking around in Bristol after then until I fell in love with the city and Aardman also kindly decided to keep me on a more permanent basis.

My time there was nothing short of awesome.
