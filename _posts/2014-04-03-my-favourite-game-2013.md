Straight off, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that my favourite game of 2013 has to be Naughty Dog's _The Last Of Us_.

And I'm pretty sure a lot people would say the exact same thing due to it's huge popularity and near perfect review scores but I enjoyed the experience that much that it comes out as one of my favourite games of all time &mdash; up there with the Final Fantasy's and Metal Gear Solid's. Which is some hefty praise.

Rather than give it a in-depth review (it needs no more of these), or pick it apart piece by piece, I'm just going to pick a few elements that made it stand out for me.

### Gore, done right

Adding gore into games is easy, often overused, and more often than not, a cheap party trick. The Last Of Us however uses this as part of their core story line, the Clickers.

The game does a great job of reminding you that despite the Clickers horrific form, they were once human. Only when push comes to shove do you have to take them out, normally resulting in a brutal melee attack.

The gore enforces the harsh and dog eat dog world your characters now inhabit.

### The world

The world itself is a character. Demolished buildings, towering ivy, the animals that live within and the atomsphere and tension you constantly keep fighting.

The Last Of Us has come at the end of the PS3's life cycle and it does look truly stunning.

### And of course, Joel &amp; Ellie

At the end of the day, everything else is just background noise when it comes down to these two. For me, it's all about how Joel and Ellie survive in this infested world together.

They were slammed together though chance but stuck and survived together.

I could go on and on, as I adore many aspects of the game but these are just of the few best bits.
