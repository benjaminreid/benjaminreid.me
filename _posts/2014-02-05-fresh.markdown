It's time for a fresh start. This site has been everything and nothing, but finally I've found a use for it that I'm happy to roll with.

For the foreseeable future this will be a place to post about code, my musings, life things and every so often, rants. It's part of a larger online de-clutter which I'm trying out at the moment. I won't go into too much detail for now but [nouveller.com/articles](http://nouveller.com/articles) will soon cease to exist.

That's all to say for now really, this will just get the ball rolling. Though, I'd like to quickly point out that I'm running this on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (after much deliberation) and hosting it on the rather handy [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). There's a post already lined up about why I chose to go with this setup, so [hold onto your butts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W6as8oVcuM).

P.S. You can fork and fix any spelling mistakes over at [the site's GitHub page](https://github.com/nouveller/benjaminreid.me).
