I'd been missing taking proper pictures on adventures out and after [reading people's experiences](http://www.cyclelove.net/2014/06/on-a-bike-with-the-fuji-x-pro1/) with the Fujifilm X's I decided to pick one up.

I could not be more happy with it. It's style, build quality and stunning results make it so worthwhile. I can chuck it on my back, go out for a ride or adventure and get some great memorable shots.

We headed over to [Leigh Woods](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Leigh+Woods+National+Nature+Reserve/@51.458255,-2.635405,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xf45849dfcb1fb3c9) to give it a test drive and here a few of the shots.
