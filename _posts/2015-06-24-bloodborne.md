It's over. I've finally finished travelling down this masochistic road that runs through the beautifully twisted world of Bloodborne.

I'm not going to go into too much detail about what makes Bloodborne so special (though I recommend [reading Eurogamer's review](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-27-bloodborne-review) if you want to find out), I just want to point at this place in time where I overcame it.

Having never played any of the Souls games before gave me no insight into what struggles I may face in Bloodborne. The first section of the game nearly made me regret my decision to enter into Old Yarnham and I almost gave up on it, but thankfully I persevered.

Once I began to grasp it's intricate mechanics and unique quirks it all began to click. It's like playing a video game back when you were a kid, there's no sign posting, no hand holding, frustratingly hard, but massively rewarding and fun.

It requires you to talk to friends just to find out where you have to go or what secret item you've walked past a thousand times that they happened to stumble across. None of this is by mistake either, it's by pure brilliant design.

From Software and Hidetaka Miyazaki, I tip my hat to you. Bloodborne is one of the best games I've ever played.
